<h2>
<a NAME="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
Suppose we want to put some MODIS 1 km Level 1b swath data covering all
of Greenland into a region of the same grid used by the <a href="http://nsidc.org/NSIDC/CATALOG/ENTRIES/nsi-0065.html">AVHRR
Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 1.25 km&nbsp; EASE-Grid Composites</a>. We
want to grid reflective channels 1 and 2, thermal channels 31 and 32, and
ancillary data channels solar zenith and sensor zenith. We could simply
order MOD021KM data; however, as we can see in <a href="index.html#datasets">Supported
Data Sets</a>, both the ancillary data and the latlon data are stored at
only 5 km resolution in MOD021KM granules. We could have <a href="index.html#mod02_usage">mod02.pl</a>
work with only the MOD021KM granules (i.e. by setting both latlon_src and
ancil_src to 1); however we decide to order the corresponding MOD03 granules
as well in order to minimize interpolation error.
<h2>
<a NAME="search"></a>Searching for the Data</h2>
Let's assume that we happen to know that the afternoon of June 1, 2000
was fairly clear, so we use the <a href="http://redhook.gsfc.nasa.gov/~imswww/pub/imswelcome/">EDG</a>
to order two MOD1KM and the corresponding two MOD03 granules acquired at
1445 and 1450 that appear to cover Greenland. You can use the following
values for performing the search using the <a href="http://redhook.gsfc.nasa.gov/~imswww/pub/imswelcome/">EDG</a>:
<p>Data Set
<br><tt>MODIS/TERRA CALIBRATED RADIANCES 5-MIN L1B SWATH 1KM</tt>
<br><tt>MODIS/TERRA GEOLOCATION FIELDS 5-MIN L1A SWATH 1KM</tt>
<p>Search Area
<br>Type in Lat/Lon Range:
<br><tt>Northern latitude: 85.0000</tt>
<br><tt>Southern latitude: 60.0000</tt>
<br><tt>Western longitude: -80.0000</tt>
<br><tt>Eastern longitude: 10.0000</tt>
<p><tt>Start Date: 2000-06-01&nbsp; Time (UTC): 14:00:00</tt>
<br><tt>End Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000-06-01&nbsp; Time (UTC): 15:00:00</tt>
<p>The search should find four granules having the following names:
<p><tt>MOD021KM.A2000153.1445.002.2000156075718.hdf</tt>
<br><tt>MOD021KM.A2000153.1450.002.2000156075717.hdf</tt>
<br><tt>MOD03.A2000153.1445.002.2000156061125.hdf</tt>
<br><tt>MOD03.A2000153.1450.002.2000156062025.hdf</tt><tt></tt>
<p>Note that June 1, 2000 is day-of-year 153.
<h2>
<a NAME="order"></a>Ordering and Downloading the Data</h2>
Order and download the above files to some directory we'll call the tutorial_1
directory where you have at least 500 MB of disk space. Note that you can
also download the *.met files that accompany the *.hdf files, but the MS2GT
software doesn't use them.
<h2>
<a NAME="command"></a>Creating the mod02.pl Command File</h2>
Create a text file in the tutorial_1 directory called gl1_2000153_1445.csh
containing the following two lines:
<p><tt>mod02.pl . gl1_2000153_1445 listfile.txt Gl1250.gpd chanfile.txt
\</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ancifile.txt 3
3</tt>
<p>This command specifies the following information (see <a href="index.html#mod02_usage">mod02.pl</a>):
<ul>
<li>
dirinout is "." indicating that the current directory in effect when gl1_2000153_1445.csh
is invoked will contain the input and output files.</li>

<li>
tag is "gl1_2000153_1445" indicating that all output filenames containing
gridded data created by mod02.pl will begin with the string "gl1_2000153_1445".</li>

<li>
listfile is "listfile.txt" containing a list of the MOD02 files to be processed
(see Creating the Listfile).</li>

<li>
gpdfile is "Gl1250.txt" containing a specification of the grid and its
associated map projection to use in gridding the data (see Creating the
*.gpd and *.mpp files).</li>

<li>
chanfile is "chanfile.txt" containing a list of the channels to be gridded
as well as specifying how each channel should be processed (see Creating
the chanfile).</li>

<li>
ancilfile is "ancilfile.txt" containing a list of the ancillary parameters
to be gridded as well as how each ancillary parameter should be processed
(see Creating the ancilfile).</li>

<li>
latlon_src is "3" indicating that for each MOD021KM file specified in the
listfile, a corresponding MOD03 file should be read, and the 1 km latitude
and longitude data in the MOD03 file should be used instead of the 5 km
latitude and longitude data in the MOD021KM file.</li>

<li>
ancil_src is "3" indicating that for each MOD021KM file specified in the
listfile, a corresponding MOD03 file should be read, and the 1 km ancillary
data in the MOD03 file should be used instead of the 5 km ancillary data
in the MOD021KM file.</li>

<li>
keep is not specified, so the default value of "0" is used indicating that
intermediate chan, lat, lon, col, and row files should be deleted.</li>

<li>
rind is not specified, so the default value of "50" is used. If you see
holes in the final grid that seem to correspond to the boundaries between
adjacent swath granules, then you might try increasing the rind value.</li>
</ul>
Make gl1_2000153_1445.csh executable by typing:
<p><tt>chmod +x gl1_2000153_1445.csh</tt>
<h2>
<a NAME="listfile"></a>Creating the listfile</h2>
Create a text file called listfile.txt in the tutorial_1 directory containing
the following two lines:
<p><tt>MOD021KM.A2000153.1445.002.2000156075718.hdf</tt>
<br><tt>MOD021KM.A2000153.1450.002.2000156075717.hdf</tt><tt></tt>
<p>Note that we list only the MOD021KM files to be gridded, not the MOD03
files since we are gridding channel data as well as ancillary data. If
we were only gridding 1 km ancillary data, then we would list the MOD03
files in listfile since there would be no need for reading the MOD021KM
files.
<h2>
<a NAME="gpdfile"></a>Creating the *.gpd and *.mpp files</h2>

<h2>
<a NAME="chanfile"></a>Creating the chanfile</h2>
Create a text file in the tutorial_1 directory called chanfile.txt containing
the following four lines:
<p><tt>1 reflectance</tt>
<br><tt>2 reflectance</tt>
<br><tt>31 temperature</tt>
<br><tt>32 temperature</tt>
<h2>
<a NAME="ancilfile"></a>Creating the ancilfile</h2>
Create a text file in the tutorial_1 directory called ancilfile.txt containing
the following two lines:
<p><tt>soze scaled</tt>
<br><tt>seze scaled</tt>
