<h2>
<a NAME="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="what"></a>What the Software Does</h3>
The MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolbox (MS2GT) is a set of software tools that
can be used to read HDF-EOS files containing MODIS swath data and produce
flat binary files containing gridded data in a variety of map projections.
Multiple input files corresponding to successively acquired 5 minute MODIS
"scenes" can be processed together to produce a seamless output grid.
<p>MS2GT consists of three perl programs that make calls to several standalone
IDL and C programs: <a href="#mod02">mod02.pl</a> which reads <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD021KM_L1B.shtml">MOD021KM</a>,
<a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02HKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02HKM</a>,
or <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02QKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02QKM</a>
Level 1b files, <a href="#mod10_l2">mod10_l2.pl</a> which reads <a href="http://nsidc.org/NSIDC/CATALOG/ENTRIES/MOD10_L2.html">MOD10_L2</a>
snow cover files, and <a href="#mod29">mod29.pl</a> which reads <a href="http://nsidc.org/NSIDC/CATALOG/ENTRIES/MOD29.html">MOD29</a>
sea ice files.&nbsp; All three Perl programs can optionally read <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD03_L1B.shtml">MOD03</a>
files for geolocation information; in addition, <a href="#mod02">mod02.pl</a>
can extract "ancillary" data (such as illumination and viewing angles)
from <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD03_L1B.shtml">MOD03</a>
files.
<h3>
<a NAME="how"></a>How the Software Works</h3>
Each of the three Perl scripts provided with MS2GT make similar calls to
the IDL and C programs outlined below:
<ul>
<li>
User-specified swath data arrays are read out of HDF-EOS files using a
suite of IDL programs written by Liam Gumley of SSEC at the University
of Wisconsin. During this step, radiance data can be left as raw integer
counts or converted to floating-point corrected counts, radiances, or reflectances;
similarly, thermal data can be left as raw counts or converted to temperatures.
These swath data arrays, including latitude and longitude arrays, are saved
as temporary data files.</li>

<li>
The latitude and longitude files are then converted to files containing
column and row numbers of the target grid by a C program called ll2cr which
uses the mapx C library written by Ken Knowles of NSIDC. The mapx library
requires the use of a user-supplied <a href="http://nsidc.org/NASA/GUIDE/docs/reference_documents/ppgc.html#parameters">Grid
Parameters Definition</a> (gpd) text file that specifies the desired grid
and associated map projection.</li>

<li>
The column and row files and any ancillary data files are then interpolated
to the resolution of the primary data files (1 km for <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD021KM_L1B.shtml">MOD021KM</a>
and <a href="http://nsidc.org/NSIDC/CATALOG/ENTRIES/MOD29.html">MOD29</a>,
500 m for <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02HKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02HKM</a>
and <a href="http://nsidc.org/NSIDC/CATALOG/ENTRIES/MOD10_L2.html">MOD10_L2</a>,
or 250 m for <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02QKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02QKM</a>)
as necessary using two IDL programs (interp_colrow.pro and interp_swath.pro).</li>

<li>
Finally, the interpolated column and row files, together with the primary
data files and any interpolated ancillary data files are run through a
C program called fornav that performs forward navigation to produce gridded
flat binary files. The user can specify that either elliptical weighted
averaging or elliptical maximum weight sampling be used during forward
navigation.</li>
</ul>
It should relatively easy for a user who is familiar with Perl and IDL
programming to modify the Perl scripts and IDL procedures in order to process
other kinds swath data using many of the same standalone programs provided
with MS2GT. Further details can be found in the <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>.
<h3>
<a NAME="requirements"></a>Requirements</h3>
In its current form, MS2GT runs on a Unix workstation with a standard C
compiler. It also requires Perl 5.0 or higher and IDL 5.0 or higher. The
installation instructions assume that the user is running csh or tcsh as
the Unix shell. Users of other shells (e.g. bash, ksh, sh, etc.) may have
to make slight changes to the installation instructions.
<p>MS2GT has been developed and tested on an SGI O2 workstation having
192 Mbytes of memory and running IRIX 6.5, perl 5.004_04, and IDL 5.4.
Care has been taken to minimize memory requirements at the expense of increased
temporary disk storage requirements and slightly slower speed. However,
in its current form, MS2GT does require that two times a grid's worth of
single precision floating-point data for one channel fit into virtual memory.
The result is that fairly large gridded images can be created on a machine
with a modest amount of memory in a fairly short time. For example, the
creation of two 1316x1384 250 m grids containing MODIS channels 1 and 2
reflectance data derived from a single MOD02QKM file takes about three
minutes on the above machine and requires about 2 * 1316 * 1384 * 4 = 15
MB of free virtual memory.

<h2>
<a NAME="installation"></a>Installation Instructions</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="obtaining"></a>Obtaining the Software</h3>
The software and associated documentation can be downloaded from <a href="ftp://baikal.colorado.edu/pub/NSIDC/ms2gt0.5.tar.gz">ftp://baikal.colorado.edu/pub/NSIDC/ms2gt.0.5.tar.gz</a>,
where 0.5 is the current version and release. Save this file into some
directory where you want the MS2GT software installed. If you have a previous
version of MS2GT installed in the same directory, you should either remove
it or rename it. For example:
<p><b><tt>rm -fr ms2gt</tt></b>
<p>or something like:
<p><b><tt>mv ms2gt ms2gt.old</tt></b>
<p>Then type:
<p><b><tt>gunzip ms2gt0.5.tar.gz | tar xvf</tt></b>
<p>This will create a directory in the current directory called ms2gt which
will contain several subdirectories. Further instructions on the installation
and use of MS2GT can be then found in html files in the ms2gt/doc subdirectory.
At this point you can delete the tar file if you want. Point your browser
to ms2gt/doc/index.html (this document).
<h3>
<a NAME="building"></a>Building the Executables</h3>
Change the current working directory to the ms2gt/src directory and type:
<p><b><tt>make all</tt></b>
<p>This will build and install the MS2GT executables under the ms2gt directory.
The only write privileges required are the ability to write into the ms2gt
directory and its subdirectories.
<h3>
<a NAME="perl"></a>Verifying your Perl Installation</h3>
Type the command:
<p><b><tt>perl -v</tt></b>
<p>If you see something like:
<p><tt>This is perl, version 5.004_04 built for irix-n32</tt>
<p><tt>Copyright 1987-1997, Larry Wall</tt>
<p><tt>Perl may be copied only under the terms of either the Artistic License
or the</tt>
<br><tt>GNU General Public License, which may be found in the Perl 5.0
source kit.</tt>
<p>then you know perl has been installed ok. Just make sure you have at
least perl version 5 installed. However, if you see something like:
<p><tt>perl: Command not found</tt>
<p>then you need to contact your system administrator to get perl installed.
<p>Assuming you have perl installed, then type:
<p><b><tt>/usr/bin/perl -v</tt></b>
<p>If you see the same message as before, then you have a proper link to
your installed version of perl. However, if you see something like:
<p><tt>/usr/bin/perl: Command not found</tt>
<p>or you see mention of a lower version of perl, then you need to contact
your system administrator and have a link called /usr/bin/perl created
that points to your installed version of perl. For example, if you type:
<p><b><tt>which perl </tt></b>(or <b><tt>type perl</tt> </b>if you're running
bash, ksh, or sh)
<p>and you see:
<p><tt>/usr/sbin/perl</tt>
<p>then the command to create the link would be:
<p><b><tt>ln -s /usr/sbin/perl /usr/bin/perl</tt></b>
<p>but you'll probably need to be logged in as root to be able to execute
this command successfully.
<h3>
<a NAME="environment"></a>Setting up the MS2GT Environment</h3>
Edit your .cshrc or your .login file and insert the following two lines:
<p><tt>setenv MS2GT_HOME $HOME/ms2gt</tt>
<br><tt>source $MS2GT_HOME/ms2gt_env.csh</tt>
<p>If you installed ms2gt into some directory other than $HOME, then change
the first line accordingly. If your .cshrc or your .login includes lines
such as:
<p><tt>setenv IDL_DIR /usr/local/rsi/idl</tt>
<br><tt>source $IDL_DIR/bin/idl_setup</tt>
<br><tt>setenv IDL_PATH ...</tt>
<p><tt>or a line such as</tt>
<p><tt>setenv PATHMPP ...</tt>
<p>then the two MS2GT lines above should be placed after these IDL and
PATHMPP lines in the appropriate file. Once your .cshrc or your .login
file has been editted, then logout and login again, or else type the following
two lines:
<p><b><tt>source ~/.cshrc </tt></b>or
<br><b><tt>source ~/.login</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>rehash</tt></b>
<p>Finally, create a writeable directory in your home directory called
tmp that will be used by a perl script called idl_sh.pl. This directory
will be used for holding temporary shell scripts for running IDL programs:
<p><b><tt>mkdir ~/tmp</tt></b>
<h3>
<a NAME="verifying"></a>Verifying the MS2GT Installation</h3>
Try typing in the following three commands to get the syntax of each of
the three perl scripts (note that the name of the first script contains
a zero (0), followed by a two (2); note that the name of the second script
contains a one (1), followed by a zero (0), followed by an underbar (_),
followed by a lower case L (l), followed by a two (2):
<p><b><tt>mod02.pl</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>mod10_l2.pl</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>mod29.pl</tt></b>
<p>You should see a usage message that describes the syntax of each perl
script that is essentially the same as <a href="mod02_usage">mod02_usage</a>,
<a href="mod10_l2_usage">mod10_l2_usage</a>
and <a href="mod29_usage">mod29_usage</a>, respectively. If you get "command
not found" or something to that effect, it probably means that your $path
is being set after the <tt>source $MS2GT_HOME/ms2gt_env.csh
</tt>command
in your .cshrc or .login file. Find the line in your .cshrc or .login that
looks like:
<p><tt>set path = &lt;something></tt>
<p>and change it to:
<p><tt>set path = ($path &lt;something>)</tt>
<p>Then logout and login and try the commands again.
<p>Next, verify that the environment variable $IDL_PATH is set correctly.
Type:
<p><b><tt>echo $IDL_PATH</tt></b>
<p>You should see a directory that looks like:
<p>&lt;<tt>something>/ms2gt/src/idl</tt>
<p>as one of the directories in the IDL path. If not, then make sure that
you placed the <tt>source</tt> <tt>$MS2GT_HOME/ms2gt_env.csh </tt>command
<i>after
</i>setting
$IDL_PATH in your .login or .cshrc as decribed <a href="#environment">above</a>.
<p>Finally, verify that the environment varialble $PATHMPP is set correctly.
Type:
<p><b><tt>echo $PATHMPP</tt></b>
<p>You should see a directory that looks like:
<p>&lt;something>/ms2gt/grids
<p>as one of the directories in PATHMPP. If not, then make sure that you
placed the <tt>source $MS2GT_HOME/ms2gt_env.csh </tt>command <i>after </i>setting
$PATHMPP in your .login or .cshrc as decribed <a href="#environment">above</a>.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="using"></a>Using the MS2GT Software</h2>
In most cases, users will need to perform the following steps in order
to use the MS2GT software (detailed examples of these steps can be found
in the <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>):
<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="searching"></a>Searching for the Data</h3>
The user needs to use the <a href="http://redhook.gsfc.nasa.gov/~imswww/pub/imswelcome/">EDG</a>
or a similar tool to find the swath data to be gridded.
<h3>
<a NAME="ordering"></a>Ordering and Downloading the Data</h3>
The user needs to use the <a href="http://redhook.gsfc.nasa.gov/~imswww/pub/imswelcome/">EDG</a>
or a similar tool to order and download the swath data to be gridded.
<h3>
<a NAME="command"></a>Creating a MS2GT Command File</h3>
The user needs to use a text editor to create a command file for running
the particular MS2GT script: <a href="#mod02">mod02.pl</a>, <a href="#mod10_l2">mod10_l2.pl</a>,
or <a href="#mod29">mod29.pl</a> . This command file contains an invocation
of the particular script together with its associated parameters. The parameters
to a particular script contain the names of miscellaneous text files (described
<a href="#miscellaneous">below</a>)
as well as other parameters used to control the operation of the script
including a specification of which data arrays in the input file(s) are
to be gridded. Alternatively, the invocation of the script and its parameters
may be simply typed in on the command line once the miscellaneous text
files have been created.
<h3>
<a NAME="miscellaneous"></a>Creating Miscellaneous Text Files</h3>
The user needs to use a text editor to create miscellaneous text files
used to control the operation of the particular <a href="#mod02">mod02.pl</a>,
<a href="#mod10_l2">mod10_l2.pl</a>,
or <a href="#mod29">mod29.pl</a> script.
<p>Each script requires a listfile which contains a list of the filenames
of the HDF-EOS files to be gridded. Each of these HDF-EOS files contains
MODIS swath data acquired over a five minute interval. Consecutively acquired
files can be gridded together to produce a seamless gridded result.
<p>Each script also requires a Grid Parameters Definition (gpd) file, which
in turn requires an associated Map Projection Parameters (mpp) file. These
files are used by the mapx library software (developed at NSIDC) to define
the grid into which the swath data is to be mapped. The format of these
files and an explanation of the mapx library is provided in <a href="http://nsidc.org/NASA/GUIDE/docs/reference_documents/ppgc.html">Points,
Pixels, Grids, and Cells</a>.
<p>Other miscellaneous text files used by some of the scripts include a
chanfile, an ancilfile, and a latlonfile.
<p>The format and use of each miscellaneous file is described <a href="#descriptions">below</a>
as well as in the <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>.
<h3>
<a NAME="running"></a>Running the MS2GT Command File</h3>
Once all the miscellaneous text files have been created, the MS2GT command
file can be invoked to actually perform the gridding, or the invocation
of the particular MS2GT script and its associated parameters may be simply
typed in on the command line.
<p>The MS2GT script runs several IDL and C programs to actually perform
the gridding as outlined <a href="#how">above</a>. Further explanations
are also provided in the <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>.
<h3>
<a NAME="examining"></a>Examining the Results</h3>
Once the particular MS2GT script has completed processing, there will exist
a single binary flat file containing the gridded data for each channel
specified in the MS2GT command file. The filenames for each flat file contain
fields that specify the type of data the file contains as well as the number
of rows and columns in the grid. The MS2GT software does not currently
provide any facility for visualizing these data, but they can be easily
imported into a variety of visualization programs.
<h3>
<a NAME="geolocating"></a>Geolocating the Results</h3>
The MS2GT software contains a utility called gridloc which can be used
to create binary floating-point flat files containing the latitude and
longitude of each cell in the grid. An example of how to use gridloc can
be found at the <a href="tutorial_1.html#geolocating">end of Tutorial 1</a>.</blockquote>

in <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD021KM_L1B.shtml">MOD021KM</a>
and <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD03_L1B.shtml">MOD03</a>
files at 5 km and 1 km resolutions, respectively. Finally the table shows
geolocation (lat-lon) data are available at either 1 km or 5km resolutions.
<p><a href="mod02_usage">mod02.pl usage</a> provides a cursory explanation
of the mod02.pl script parameters. A more expanded discussion of each parameter
is provided here. Note that the first five parameters to mod02.pl are required;
the rest are optional.
<ol>
<li>
<i>dirinout</i> - the directory containing all input files required by
mod02.pl and all output files created by mod02.pl. If input files must
reside in some other area, then the user will need to create links to each
of these files in the dirinout directory.</li>

<li>
<i>tag</i> - a string used in constructing the names of output files. Each
output filename will begin with the <i>tag</i> string.</li>

<li>
<i>listfile</i> - the name of a text file containing the names of the <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD021KM_L1B.shtml">MOD021KM</a>,
<a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02HKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02HKM</a>,
<a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02QKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02QKM</a>,
or <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD03_L1B.shtml">MOD03</a>
swath files to be gridded. If multiple files are present in <i>listfile</i>,
then the files must all be of the same type (e.g. if the first file is
a <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD021KM_L1B.shtml">MOD021KM</a>
file, then all subsequent files must also be <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD021KM_L1B.shtml">MOD021KM</a>
files). Multiple files must have been acquired at subsequent acquisition
times without any gaps. If <i>chanfile</i> (below) is "none", then <i>listfile</i>
must contain a list of one or <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD03_L1B.shtml">MOD03</a>
files from which the 1 km ancillary data specified in ancilfile (below)
will be read. If <i>chanfile</i> is not "none", then <i>listfile</i> must
contain a list of one or more <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD021KM_L1B.shtml">MOD021KM</a>,
<a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02HKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02HKM</a>,
or <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD02QKM_L1B.shtml">MOD02QKM</a>
files from which the 1 km, 500 m, or 250 m channel data, respectively,
specified in <i>chanfile</i> will be read. If, in this latter case, <i>ancilfile</i>
is also not "none", then the 5 km data specified in <i>ancilfile</i> will
be read from <a href="http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/MODIS/rad_geo/MOD03_L1B.shtml">MOD03</a>
files whose filenames are constructed from the corresponding filenames
in <i>chanfile</i> by substituting the MOD021KM, MOD02HKM, or MOD02QKM
filename prefix with MOD03.</li>

<li>
<i>gpdfile</i> - the name of a Grid Parameters Definition (gpd) file that
defines the desired output grid. See <a href="http://nsidc.org/NASA/GUIDE/docs/reference_documents/ppgc.html">Points,
Pixels, Grids, and Cells</a> the <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>
for more details.</li>

<li>
<i>chanfile</i> - the name of a text file containing a list of the channels
to be gridded, one line per channel.&nbsp; If <i>chanfile</i> is "none"
then no channel data will be gridded and <i>ancilfile</i> must not be "none".
Each line in <i>chanfile </i>can have up to four fields as described in
<a href="mod02_usage">mod02.pl
usage</a>. Note that if the first file in
<i>listfile</i> begins with MOD03,
then <i>chanfile</i> must be "none" and both <i>latlon_src</i> and <i>ancil_src</i>
(described below) are forced to 3. The channels specified in <i>chanfile</i>
are always read from the files specified in <i>listfile</i>.</li>

<li>
<i>ancilfile</i> - the name of a text file containing a list of ancillary
parameters to be gridded, one line per parameter. The default is "none"
indicating that no ancillary parameters should be gridded. Each line in
ancilfile can have up to four fields as described in
<a href="mod02_usage">mod02.pl
usage</a>.</li>
